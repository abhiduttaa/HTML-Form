# HTML-Form
This HTML form, titled "Complex Form," collects detailed personal information. It includes fields for first and last names, email, phone number, date, gender, and country. Additional sections gather address details (street, zip code, city, state) and other information (comments, terms of service agreement). A submit button finalizes the input.
